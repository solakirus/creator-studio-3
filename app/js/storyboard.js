/* The link between this app and the storyboard app.

   Both are Capacitor apps on the same phone, so each declares a URL scheme and
   Android does the switching. Nothing is shared between their databases — what
   travels is an id and a way back.

     out:  storyboard://board/<id>?from=creatorstudio&back=<a link to here>
     in:   com.creatorstudio.v2://go/vlog/<id>   (handled in js/shortcuts.js)

   The return link is the part worth having. Jumping to a board and then hunting
   for where you came from is worse than not jumping at all, so every link out
   carries the way back.

   For this to work the storyboard app has to declare the scheme in its
   manifest and route the path on launch — the same two things this app already
   does. See native/STORYBOARD.md. */
