/* What a clip is, and where it is in its life.

   There used to be two models for the same thing. A "clip" belonged to a series
   and moved raw → queued → posted; a "video" belonged to a channel and moved
   idea → planned → shot → editing → published. Same object, two vocabularies,
   and nothing linking them — you could make the same piece twice.

   This is the one vocabulary, and the map from both old ones. Nothing is
   rewritten on disk: records are upgraded as they are read, so an app that has
   not opened in a month still makes sense. */
